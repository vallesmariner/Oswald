# Oswald
Oswald photo recreation.

  This is open source, free, go have fun.  I made the Oswald 3d model, skin and rigged skeleton, so nobody could silence this via a copyright claim.  I tried to recreate the Lee Harvey Oswald scene.

  I removed the reference photos for the human male that belong to illustratedmale.com

  I made this because I was pissed at a JFK documentary that said something was true, just because a "expert" had recreated it in 3D.
Then I saw this: http://mentalfloss.com/article/70065/dartmouth-researchers-authenticate-controversial-photo-jfks-assassin
  Another of example of 3D "might makes right", and it was climbing the charts at Reddit.
  
  With every computing device, down to a $40 Raspberry Pi having 3D graphics capabilities, I think it is reasonable to share research data in 3D, and let the evidence speak for itself.  

  I think all of these can be presented in WebGL, so if I find the time or energy, I'll start move this to a format everyone can examine.
